## IMPLEMENTATION

  ### The project was developed only by using HTML and CSS code.
  
  ### Main concept that I use was `display:flex` feature, due to flexibility to position the boxes as closely possible.  
  
  ### The web was supported on live URL by the `PAGE` tools offer by GitHub.
  
  ### I develop the code based on the information from the following sites: 
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS
  - https://lenguajecss.com/css/
  - https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
